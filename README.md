### **What is Networking?**
Networking refers to the exchange of data between computers over a shared medium. It can involve wired connections (Ethernet) or wireless technologies (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).

### **Types of Networks**:
- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: A network within a small geographic area like a home or office.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: A larger network that spans cities, countries, or even continents.
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: A network that covers a city.

### **Important Networking Devices**:
- **Router**: Directs traffic between different networks.
- **Switch**: Connects devices within the same network.
- **Firewall**: Monitors and filters incoming and outgoing traffic to protect the network.

## **3. OSI Model (7 Layers of Networking)**

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model defines how communication occurs between two devices. It is composed of **7 layers**:

1. **Physical Layer**: The physical connection between devices (cables, switches).
2. **Data Link Layer**: Manages the movement of data within the same network (MAC addresses).
3. **Network Layer**: Routes the data across networks (IP addresses).
4. **Transport Layer**: Ensures reliable data transmission (TCP/UDP).
5. **Session Layer**: Manages the sessions between network connections.
6. **Presentation Layer**: Translates the data into a format the application can understand.
7. **Application Layer**: The layer closest to the user, such as email clients, web browsers.

### **What is Blockchain?**
Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions across many computers. It is primarily known for its role in **cryptocurrency** like Bitcoin, 
but its applications go far beyond finance.

### **Key Features of Blockchain**:
- **Decentralization**: No central authority controls the network.
- **Immutability**: Once data is written, it cannot be altered.
- **Transparency**: Everyone has access to the same version of the ledger.
- **Consensus Algorithms**: Determine how nodes agree on the state of the blockchain

### **Applications of Blockchain**:
- **Cryptocurrency**: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others use blockchain for secure transactions.
- **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing contracts with the terms written in code.
- **Supply Chain**: Track the origin and movement of goods with immutable records.
- **Internet of Things (IoT):** Blockchain enhances IoT security by providing a tamper-proof record of device interactions.It ensures data integrity and enables secure communication between devices

### **What is a Database?**
A **database** is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically. It allows for data storage, management, and retrieval.<br> <b>or</b> <br>
a database is a systematic way of storing and organizing data for easy access, analysis, and modification. 
### **Types of Databases**:
- *Relational Databases (RDBMS)*: Store data in tables and use SQL for querying (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- *NoSQL Databases**: Flexible schema databases, ideal for large-scale applications (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).
- *Cloud Databases*: Cloud databases are hosted and managed in the cloud by service providers.
 They offer scalability, high availability, and ease of deployment.

## **8. Cloud Computing**

### **What is Cloud Computing?**
Cloud computing provides on-demand computing resources over the internet. It eliminates the need for maintaining physical hardware and offers flexible, scalable solutions.

### **Cloud Services**:
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Virtual machines, networking.
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: Development platforms and tools.
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Ready-to-use software applications.
